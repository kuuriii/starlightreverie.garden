				<p>Time for an update!!</p>
				<p>
					So after realizing Yui has updated her website I have been
					inspired to update mine as well. I planned on doing this
					earlier but life happens. Anyways stay tuned for the next
					couple of weeks as I'll be completely revamping this
					website!!

					<b>Added Dec 16. 2024:</b>
					A few more things, this website will not be updated after
					next week as it is the Christmas season. Yay! :( ... So
					anyways see you all after the break, I'll make a post then.
